In this paper, we implement Path Planning strategy for Multi Robots using Compact Voronoi Diagrams [1] . Size of Generalized Voronoi diagrams depends upon total vertices of polygons in the workspace. Current paper focuses on implementing Voronoi-like diagram for which size is a function of the number of polygons only with time complexity of O(logn) [1] per each modification. Certain important features of Voronoi diagrams are maintained instead of complete structure for path planning for each robot. Current implementation can be extended to path planning of a swarm in a dynamic environment.

Thank You!
